Android XMPP Client
=================

Creating an XMPP Client for Android devices to connect with an XMPP server

My goal is to create an open source XMPP client for Android where the App has the features
1) Connect to a XMPP server, add new users 
2) Provide a friends list 
3) Interractive UI
4) Able to store chat history or disabling it

Any contribution is greatly appreciated.
